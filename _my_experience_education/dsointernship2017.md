<ul>
    <li>
    Conventional robot actuators often face the problem of being limited to a specific operating environment.
    </li>
    <li>
    We explore the use of a low-cost reaction wheel to actuate rotational motion for
    robotic locomotion. Together with an Inertial Measurement Unit, the reaction wheel can be controlled to produce different amounts of torque with changes in the topography of the surrounding environment.
    </li>
    <li>
    This allows for the possibility of all-terrain locomotion across harsh environments.
