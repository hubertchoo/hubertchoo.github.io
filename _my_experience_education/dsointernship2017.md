Conventional robot actuators often face the problem of being limited to a specific operating environment.
<br>
We explore the use of a low-cost reaction wheel to actuate rotational motion for
robotic locomotion. Together with an Inertial Measurement Unit, the reaction wheel can be controlled to respond to changes in the topography of the surrounding environment, enabling the robot to alter the amount of torque produced based on the scenario. As such, the robot is highly adaptable and versatile, allowing for the possibility of all-terrain locomotion across harsh environments.
