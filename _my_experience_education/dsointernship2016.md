In order to smoothen the notoriously steep learning curve of the C programming language, with its many <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_Traps_and_Pitfalls">traps and pitfalls</a>, the following 3 questions of interest was investigated:
<br>
<b>1.</b> What are the concepts that are problematic for new C programmers?
<br>
<b>2.</b> Is it possible to provide a coherent mapping of C concepts to metaphors?
<br>
<b>3.</b> Is it possible to define execution rules for the metaphors while conforming to the C specification?
<br>
This provides the basis for future work that can provide an answer to a fourth question of interest: 
<br>
<b>4.</b> Is such a metaphorical construct an effective learning aid for C beginners?
