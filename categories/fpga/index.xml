Design and build a balancing rover (Segway), that can autonomously navigate and map a maze, with the assistance of three beacons. Finally, the shortest path through the maze should be computed and followed. A prototype of the design must be built and tested on the artificial maze in the lab. The maze is laid out with light strips on an arena.</description></item><item><title>My Boards and My Software</title><link>https://hubertchoo.github.io/posts/2023/07/my-boards-and-my-software/</link><pubDate>Wed, 05 Jul 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hubertchoo.github.io/posts/2023/07/my-boards-and-my-software/</guid><description>The FPGA Boards I Use DE10-Lite MAX10 10M50DAF484C7G Device DE10-Nano Intel CycloneÂ® V SE 5CSEBA6U23I7 device 800MHz Dual-core ARM Cortex-A9 hard processor The Daughter Boards I Use D8M-GPIO 8 Mega Pixel Digital Camera Package with GPIO interface The Software I Use Quartus Prime Lite 18.1 NIOS II Embedded Design Suite (EDS) ModelSim - Intel FPGA Starter Edition 10.5b</description></item><item><title>What Do I Learn To Be An FPGA Engineer?</title><link>https://hubertchoo.github.io/posts/2023/07/what-do-i-learn-to-be-an-fpga-engineer/</link><pubDate>Mon, 03 Jul 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hubertchoo.github.io/posts/2023/07/what-do-i-learn-to-be-an-fpga-engineer/</guid><description>How Do I Break Into The FPGA Industry? That is the title of this Reddit thread. One of the top comments mention the following:
In no particular order. FPGA - Learn to write either Verilog, SystemVerilog or VHDL, the ones you don't know how to write, at least know how to read. - Know the existence of new HDLs like SpinalHDL, Chisel, Amaranth, Bluespec-SV, etc. You do not necessarily have to know or use them, but know they exist and why.</description></item></channel></rss>
