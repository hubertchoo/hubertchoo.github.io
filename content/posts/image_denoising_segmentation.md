## Y2 Summer Project Introduction

For the Imperial EEE Department, the Y2 Summer Term project was to: 
1. Design and build a balancing rover (Segway),
2. that can autonomously navigate and map a maze,
3. with the assistance of three beacons.
4. Finally, the shortest path through the maze should be computed and followed.

A prototype of the design must be built and tested on the artificial maze in the lab. The maze is laid out with light strips on an arena. The arena is coloured black and surrounded by black curtains.
