Design and build a balancing rover (Segway), that can autonomously navigate and map a maze, with the assistance of three beacons. Finally, the shortest path through the maze should be computed and followed. A prototype of the design must be built and tested on the artificial maze in the lab. The maze is laid out with light strips on an arena.</description></item></channel></rss>
